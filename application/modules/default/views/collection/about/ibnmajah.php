<p><div class=section>Author bio:</div>
Abu `Abdullah Muhammad bin Yazid bin `Abdullah Rab`i Al-Qazvini, famously known as Ibn Majah, was born in 209 AH in the tribe of Rab`i in Qazvin (Iran). He was a non-Arab. Various explanations have been given for his nickname Ibn Majah, the more prominent being that Majah was his mother. Some scholars believe that Majah was the nickname of his father.<br>

<br><div class=section>Travels to learn Hadith:</div>
Ibn Majah spent his early years studying Hadith in his hometown of Qazvin, which had by then become a major center of hadith sciences. In 203 AH, at the age of 21 or 22, he travelled to seek more knowledge. He travelled to Khurasan, Iraq, Hijaz, Egypt, and Sham to attend gatherings of hadith scholars. He also studied under scholars in Makkah and Madinah and later travelled to Baghdad, which, according to Imam adh-Dhahabi was the home of chains of narration and memorization the (Dar al isnad al `ali wal hifz), the seat of the caliphate and knowledge. He never gave up on his quest for knowledge and continued his travels to Damascus, Homs, Egypt, Isfahan, Ashkelon, and Nishapur and became a pupil of the major scholars of Hadith of those times. Ibn Majah studied under some of the most prominent teachers in in Makkah, Madinah, and Qazvin. He also had a large number of pupils scattered far and wide, in Qazvin, Isfahan, Hamadan, Baghdad, and other places.<br>

<br><div class=section>His rank among scholars:</div>
Imam Ibn Majah was a great hadith scholar, interpreter of the Qur’an, and historian, whose outstanding rank has been acknowledged by various scholars of different ages. Imam adh-Dhahabi says, “Imam Ibn Majah remembered ahadith by heart. He was a critic in the field of Hadith Sciences, truthful, upright and a man of wide learning.” In Tadhkiratul-Huffaz he writes, “He was a great memorizer of ahadith and a hadith scholar and Qur’an exegete.” Abu Ya`la said, “He was very trustworthy and an authority; and had a deep knowledge of the hadith sciences.” `Allamah Sindi said, “Among the imams of hadith, he had a high rank, was pious and a trustworthy scholar by consensus.”<br>

<br><div class=section>Works:</div>
Upon completing his education, Imam Ibn Majah dedicated the later years of his life to writing and left behind three great works, namely as-Sunan, at-Tafseer, and at-Tareekh. As-Sunan is a prominent collection of Hadith ranked sixth among the six sound books of Hadith. At-Tafseer is a commentary on the Qur’an in which Imam Ibn Majah collected ahadith and comments of the companions and Tabi`in supported with chains of narrations. At-Tareekh is a great book of history and a manifestation of his knowledge and scholarship. The last two books, praised by scholars such as Ibn Kathir, no longer exist.<br>

<br><div class=section>Death:</div>
Imam Abu `Abdullah Muhammad Ibn Majah Al-Qazvini died on Monday, 22 Ramadan, in the year 273 AH at the age of 64. The poet, Muhammad bin Aswad Qazvini eulogized: “The loss of Ibn Majah weakened the column of the throne of knowledge and shook up its pillars.”<br>

<br><div class=section>His Sunan:</div>
The Sunan of Ibn Majah is a collection of ahadith mostly arranged according to Fiqh chapters, but also includes other topics such as ‘aqidah, interpretation of dreams, tribulations, and asceticism. Sunan Ibn Majah is considered one of the greatest works of Hadith. When Imam Abu Zur`ah Razi, a Hadith authority of his time was shown this work, he remarked, “If this book reached the public, all or most of the existing Jami` would cease to be used.” These words were proven true later when Sunan Ibn Majah eclipsed several of the Jawami`, Musnad and Sunan of those times.<br><br>
Sunan Ibn Majah contains 37 books, 1560 chapters and 4341 ahadith. It includes 1339 additional ahadith, known as Zawa’id of Sunan Ibn Majah which are not found in the other five major books of Hadith. According to Fuwad `Abdul Baqi`, of the 1339 additional ahadith contained therein, 428 ahadith are Sahih, 199 are Hasan, 613 Da`if, and 99 are Munkar (denounced) and Maudu` (fabricated). Sheikh Nasiruddin al-Albani, in his book Sahih wa Da`if Sunan Ibn Majah counted 948 Da`if ahadith.
<br><br>
Ibn Majah did not write an introduction to his book, so the conditions for the ahadith in his collection are not explicit. However, there are indications that he was concerned with collecting as many ahadith as possible on Fiqh issues. Sunan Ibn Majah contains a larger number of ahadith than any of the other five books without repetition. It also includes a greater number of weak ahadith than the other five. Ibn Majah was enthusiastic about finding evidences for Fiqh issues. His purpose may have been to collect as many ahadith, and find the chain of narrations for the ahadith that were the basis of rulings on Fiqh issues of the time, regardless of their authenticity or chain of narrators.
<br><br>
Certain qualities of Sunan Ibn Majah set it apart from the other books of Hadith and made it popular among scholars of all times:
<ul>
<li>It is written in an excellent style; the chapter titles are in harmony with the hadith listed and follow the same order as books of Islamic Jurisprudence.</li>
<li>The chapters are well-ordered and well-arranged, with no repetition of ahadith (a quality lacking in other Hadith books).</li>
<li>It is brief but comprehensive with respect to legal rulings.
</li>
<li>On several occasions, Ibn Majah identified ahadith that are Gharib (unfamiliar). Imam at-Tirmidhi had done this earlier, but Ibn Majah’s classification in some special chapters are unique.</li>
<li>Ibn Majah gives the name of the town the narrator of hadith belonged to.</li>
<li>He added 482 new Sahih ahadith that are not in the other five books of hadith.</li>
<li>Sunan Ibn Majah includes 3002 ahadith that are common with the other five books, but Ibn Majah narrated them with a different channels of narration. The multiplicity of channels strengthen these ahadith. This distinguishing quality is unique to Ibn Majah and is not found in any other book of hadith.</li>
<li>It contains 1339 ahadith that are not found in any of the other five books. These additions, also known as Zawa’id have elevated Sunan Ibn Majah to the position of the “sixth of the Six”.</li>
